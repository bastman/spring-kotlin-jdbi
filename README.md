## Whats wrong with orm, jpa, hibernate and in-memory h2-db these days ?

There is no silver bullet. 
It's born in a world of single-instance big fat application servers.
It hardly fits into a modern world of:

- functional programming: e.g. immutable threadsafe pojos / data classes 
- CQRS and eventsourcing
- horizontal scaling of polyglot microservices
